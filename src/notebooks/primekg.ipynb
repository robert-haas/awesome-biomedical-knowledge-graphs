The numbers suggest that originally there are 4,050,249 undirected edges, but the final knowledge graph contains 8,100,498 directed edges, i.e. two directed edges for each undirected one. Why this redundant way of storing the information was chosen remains unclear."

    "\n",
    "This section first converts the raw data to an intermediate format used in several notebooks, and then reconstructs the knowledge graph from the standardized data with shared code.\n",
    "- The intermediate form of the data is created as two simple Python lists, one for nodes and the other for edges, which can be exported to two CSV files.\n",
    "- The knowledge graph is built as a graph object from the Python package [igraph](https://igraph.org/python), which can be exported to a [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Convert the data into a standardized format\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform the raw data to an standardized format that is compatible with most biomedical knowledge graphs in order to enable shared downstream processing:\n",
    "- Each node is represented by three items: `id (str), type (str), properties (dict)`\n",
    "- Each edge is represented by four items: `source_id (str), target_id (str), type(str), properties (dict)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This format was initially inspired by a straightforward way in which the content of a Neo4j graph database can be exported to two CSV files, one for all nodes and the other for all edges. This is an effect of the [property graph model](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/graphdb-concepts/) used in Neo4j and many other graph databases, which also appears to be general enough to fully capture the majority of biomedical knowledge graphs described in scientific literature, despite the large variety of formats they are shared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second motivation was that each line represents a single node or edge, and that no entry is connected to any sections at other locations, such as property descriptions at the beginning of a GraphML file. This structural simplicity makes it very easy to load just a subset of nodes and edges by picking a subset of lines, or to skip the loading of properties if they not required for a task simply by ignoring a single column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this format also allows to load the data directly into popular SQL databases like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with built-in CSV functions ([CSV in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/draft/cli.html#importing_files_as_csv_or_other_formats), [CSV in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/loading-tables.html), [CSV in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html)). Further, the JSON string in the property column can be accessed directly by built-in JSON functions ([JSON in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [JSON in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/json-function-reference.html), [JSON in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)), which enables sophisticated queries that access or modify specific properties within the JSON data.\n",

    "This section explores small subgraphs of the knowledge graph in two ways: first by inspecting the direct neighborhood of a selected node, and second by finding shortest paths between two chosen nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple case study, the goal is to identify some nodes in the knowledge graph that are associated with the success story of the drug Imatinib, which was one of the first [targeted therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy) against cancer. Detailed background information can for example be found in an article by the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/gleevec) and in a [talk by Brian Druker](https://www.ibiology.org/human-disease/imatinib-paradigm-targeted-cancer-therapies) who played a major role in the development of this paradigm-changing drug. To give a simplified summary, following biological entities and relationships are involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutation: In a bone marrow stem cell, a translocation event between chromosome 9 and 22 leads to what has been called the [Philadelphia chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome), which can be seen under a microscope and got named after the city it originally got discovered in.\n",
    "- Gene: It turned out that this particular rearrangement of DNA fuses the [BCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCR_(gene)) gene on chromosome 22 to the [ABL1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABL_(gene)) gene on chromosome 9, resulting in a new fusion gene known as BCR-ABL1.\n",
    "- Disease: BCR-ABL1 acts as an oncogene, because it expresses a protein that is a defective [tyrosine kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase) in a permanent \"on\" state, which leads to uncontrolled growth of certain white blood cells and their precursors, thereby driving the disease [Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia).\n",
    "- Drug: [Imatinib (Gleevec)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib) was the first demonstration that a potent and selective [Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcr-Abl_tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor) is possible and that such a targeted inhibition of an oncoprotein halts the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells with BCR-ABL1, while having significantly less effect on other cells in the body compared to conventional chemotherapies used in cancer. This revolutionized the treatment of CML and drastically improved the five-year survival rate of patients from less than 20% to over 90%, as well as their quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality the story is a bit more complex, for example because there are other genes involved in disease progression, there are many closely related forms of leukemia, BCR-ABL1 also plays a role in other forms of cancer, there are several drugs available as treatment options today, all of them bind to more than one target and with different affinities, and their individual binding profiles are relevant to their particular therapeutic effects. Inspecting the knowledge graph will focus on highlighting some entities of the simplified story, but the surrounding elements will also indicate some of the complexity encountered in reality. Some simple forms of reasoning on the knowledge graph will demonstrate its potential for discovering new patterns and hypotheses.\n",

    "- Disease-Drug relations: The disease CML (red node with label `30039` in center) stands in an \"indication\", \"contraindication\" or \"off-label use\" relation to many drugs (green nodes). The type of relation can be seen when hovering over an arrow. The schema also summarized the edge types found between pairs of node types.\n",
    "  - Example: CML is linked to drug `14207` (=[Imatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib)), which in turn is linked via \"drug_drug\" relations to many other drugs such as `14794` (=[Dasatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib)) or `15429` (=[Ponatinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponatinib)), all of which are tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and form a cluster here. On the other hand, some drugs like `19886` ([Omacetaxine mepesuccinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omacetaxine_mepesuccinate)), which is a natural plant alkaloid used in CML treatment, are isolated in this subgraph. The choice of edge types does not make clear what the meaning behind the presence or absence of these associations is.\n",
    "- Disease-Gene relations: The disease CML stands in a \"disease_protein\" relation with many nodes of type \"gene/protein\" (blue nodes).\n",
    "  - Example: Gene `1530` represents BCR and is connected to CML, to the tyrosine-kinase inhibitors just mentioned, and to gene `601` which represents ABL1."

    "- The drug Imatinib with id `14207` (green node on the left) is not only used in the treatment of the disease CML, but also affecting other diseases, including AML with id `99701` (red node on the right). There is no direct link between Imatinib and AML present in the PrimeKG knowledge graph, but this subgraph shows a few genes (blue nodes in the middle) by which the effect of Imatinib on AML might be facilitated, such as `2108` (=[KIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIT_(gene))) or `1573` (=[CSFR1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_stimulating_factor_1_receptor)).\n",
    "- A simple pattern like this suggests that a link between Imatinib and AML could be discovered by a suitable link prediction method. Similar but perhaps a bit more complex patterns between other nodes may uncover indirect relationships between compounds and diseases that are not yet known. This is one way of forming drug repurposing hypotheses, which means that a drug that has already been shown in clinical trials to be safe to humans could potentially be effective in the treatment of another disease too and thereby find a new purpose.\n",
    "- The paths involve many other disease nodes that are subforms of AML such as `83859` (\"acute myeloid leukemia with t(9;11)(p22;q23)\") or `83861` (\"acute myeloid leukemia with NPM1 somatic mutations\"). This shows that PrimeKG contains a lot of highly specific disease nodes. Some analyses might profit from aggregating subforms of diseases into a single general node."
