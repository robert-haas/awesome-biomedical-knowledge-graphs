    "- Inspecting the raw data resulted in **10 node types**, which matches the number mentioned in the publication.\n",
    "  - The numbers of instances per node type partially match those presented in a visualization on the [website](https://bis.zju.edu.cn/hald). They differ for example in the case of Lipids (177 here vs. 199 on the website). This observation fits to the difference in total node count.\n",
    "- Inspecting the raw data resulted in **3044 edge types**, while the publication did not specify any number for edge types.\n",
    "  - The reason for the large number of edge types and the omission of a quantification in the publication may be due to the method used for detecting edges. It is based on a natural language processing pipeline designed to \"extract open-domain relation triples with no schema input for relations in advance\". This means the types of edges are not predetermined by the authors, as is often the case in other projects, but comes directly from the texts used as input for the NLP pipeline.\n",
    "- Looking at **relative frequencies of node and edge types** suggests that the dataset is rather unbalanced.\n",
    "  - The most frequent node type is \"Gene\" with 5624 instances, while the least frequent node type is \"Toxin\" with only 13 instances, a difference of two orders of magnitude.\n",
    "  - The most frequent edge type is \"associated\" with 19110 instances, while the least frequent edge types only have 1 instance each, partly because they come from highly specific phrases only present in one source text.\n",
    "  - This result may be intentional to accurately represent how the source texts describe relationships, but some downstream analyses might be improved if highly similar edge types were combined into a single new type and perhaps if too infrequent ones were dropped. Indeed, one analysis presented in the publication goes into that direction: \"In the Biomarkers Identification phase, we classified the relationships into positive, association, and negative ones based on their types. Further\n",
    "identification as biomarkers for human aging and longevity was performed.\" and \"Finally, the entities were further identified as human aging and longevity biomarkers according to their relationships with aging-related diseases.\""

The coloring scheme is based on a deliberately simple RGB palette with the same meaning across multiple notebooks to enable some visual comparison. The idea behind it is to highlight an interplay of certain entities, namely that drugs (or small molecules in general) can bind to proteins (or gene products in general) and thereby alter diseases (or involved pathways).\n",

    "- Each edge in the schema stands for an edge type in the data, but it is possible that the same edge type appears between different nodes. In this schema, however, a single edge represents multiple edge types because there are so many of them in HALD. Hovering over an arrow provides the number of edge types it represents and lists all of them.\n",
    "  - *Edge size* represents the number of instances, i.e. how often that edge type is present in the knowledge graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section first converts the raw data to an intermediate format used in several notebooks, and then reconstructs the knowledge graph from the standardized data with shared code.\n",
    "- The intermediate form of the data is created as two simple Python lists, one for nodes and the other for edges, which can be exported to two CSV files.\n",
    "- The knowledge graph is built as a graph object from the Python package [igraph](https://igraph.org/python), which can be exported to a [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Convert the data into an standardized format\n",
    "\n",
    "Transform the raw data to an standardized format that is compatible with most biomedical knowledge graphs in order to enable shared downstream processing:\n",
    "- Each node is represented by three items: `id (str), type (str), properties (dict)`\n",
    "- Each edge is represented by four items: `source_id (str), target_id (str), type(str), properties (dict)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This format was initially inspired by a straightforward way in which the content of a Neo4j graph database can be exported to two CSV files, one for all nodes and the other for all edges. This is an effect of the [property graph model](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/appendix/graphdb-concepts/) used in Neo4j and many other graph databases, which also appears to be general enough to fully capture the majority of biomedical knowledge graphs described in scientific literature, despite the large variety of formats they are shared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second motivation was that each line represents a single node or edge, and that no entry is connected to any sections at other locations, such as property descriptions at the beginning of a GraphML file. This structural simplicity makes it very easy to load just a subset of nodes and edges by picking a subset of lines, or to skip the loading of properties if they not required for a task simply by ignoring a single column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this format also allows to load the data directly into popular SQL databases like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with built-in CSV functions ([CSV in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/draft/cli.html#importing_files_as_csv_or_other_formats), [CSV in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/loading-tables.html), [CSV in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html)). Further, the JSON string in the property column can be accessed directly by built-in JSON functions ([JSON in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [JSON in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/json-function-reference.html), [JSON in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)), which enables sophisticated queries that access or modify specific properties within the JSON data.\n",

    "As a simple case study, the goal is to identify some nodes in the knowledge graph that are associated with the success story of the drug Imatinib, which was one of the first [targeted therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy) against cancer. Detailed background information can for example be found in an article by the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/gleevec) and in a [talk by Brian Druker](https://www.ibiology.org/human-disease/imatinib-paradigm-targeted-cancer-therapies) who played a major role in the development of this paradigm-changing drug. To give a simplified summary, following biological entities and relationships are involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutation: In a bone marrow stem cell, a translocation event between chromosome 9 and 22 leads to what has been called the [Philadelphia chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_chromosome), which can be seen under a microscope and got named after the city it originally got discovered in.\n",
    "- Gene: It turned out that this particular rearrangement of DNA fuses the [BCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCR_(gene)) gene on chromosome 22 to the [ABL1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABL_(gene)) gene on chromosome 9, resulting in a new fusion gene known as BCR-ABL1.\n",
    "- Disease: BCR-ABL1 acts as an oncogene, because it expresses a protein that is a defective [tyrosine kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase) in a permanent \"on\" state, which leads to uncontrolled growth of certain white blood cells and their precursors, thereby driving the disease [Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia).\n",
    "- Drug: [Imatinib (Gleevec)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib) was the first demonstration that a potent and selective [Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcr-Abl_tyrosine-kinase_inhibitor) is possible and that such a targeted inhibition of an oncoprotein halts the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells with BCR-ABL1, while having significantly less effect on other cells in the body compared to conventional chemotherapies used in cancer. This revolutionized the treatment of CML and drastically improved the five-year survival rate of patients from less than 20% to over 90%, as well as their quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality the story is a bit more complex, for example because there are other genes involved in disease progression, there are many closely related forms of leukemia, BCR-ABL1 also plays a role in other forms of cancer, there are several drugs available as treatment options today, all of them bind to more than one target and with different affinities, and their individual binding profiles are relevant to their particular therapeutic effects. Inspecting the knowledge graph will focus on highlighting some entities of the simplified story, but the surrounding elements will also indicate some of the complexity encountered in reality. Some simple forms of reasoning on the knowledge graph will demonstrate its potential for discovering new patterns and hypotheses.\n",

    "- Since there's not that much information about this disease in HALD, it is possible to visualize its entire neighborhood, including all individual edges, thereby illustrating that the same pair of nodes can be connected by multiple edges of different types. This comes from the fact that HALD analyses scientific texts to recognize entities and to identify verbs between them. These connective words are then used as edge types, which explains why there's a large number of them in the knowledge graph and why two nodes often have a lot of edges between them. Hovering over any edge in this visualization shows its type, e.g. \"include\" or \"associated\" are present several times."

However, one can indeed find studies such as this [publication](https://doi.org/10.4084%2FMJHID.2020.004), which suggests there is indeed a link between TET2 and CML that could be further investigated."

Here the presence of 1) many indirect links via 2) thematically similar nodes suggested there could be a relevant connection between two nodes that is not yet part of the knowledge graph, and a look at literature showed this might actually be the case. In network theory, the task of [link prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_prediction) captures this idea as the identification of \"unobserved true links\"."
